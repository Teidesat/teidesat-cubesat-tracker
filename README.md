# TeideSat Satellite Tracking for the Optical Ground Station

The TeideSat CubeSat tracking program offers an API that enables real-time monitoring from any location on Earth.

Utilizing computer vision algorithms, this program provides the satelliteâ€™s ephemeris, which includes the elevation angle and azimuth angle. These values, obtained in real-time from video camera frames and TLE coordinates, allow for accurate and up-to-date tracking of the TeideSat CubeSat.
