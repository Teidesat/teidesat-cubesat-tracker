In this folder can be found some videos used to test the implemented algorithms.

A detailed explanation of each video is shown below.

* video1: "simple" test-video from internet in it's original state (video stored at 30 fps).
* video2: a copy from video1 where the brightest star has been "removed" from half of the frames to simulate the satellite blinking at a frequency of 15 Hz (video stored at 30 fps).
* video3: a more "complex" test-video from internet in it's original state (video stored at 30 fps).
* video4: a copy from video3 where a satellite that crosses the sky (from 00:30 to 00:40 aprox) has been "removed" from half of the frames to simulate the satellite blinking at a frequency of 15 Hz (video stored at 30 fps).
* video5: a copy from video3 where a satellite that crosses the sky (from 00:30 to 00:40 aprox) has been "removed" from two thirds of the frames to simulate the satellite blinking at a frequency of 10 Hz (video stored at 30 fps).
* video6: a copy from video5 downscaled to 480p to lose information to make some tests.
* video7: a copy from video6 upscaled to 1080p again to maintain the number of pixels but with the information of the 480p version to make some tests.
